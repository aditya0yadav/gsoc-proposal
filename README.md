## Project Description

### Abstract
The project aims to extend Apache Beam's ML capabilities by integrating Vector Databases and Feature Stores, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of high-dimensional vectors and ML features. This integration will bridge the gap between Beam's powerful data processing capabilities and modern ML infrastructure requirements, facilitating more efficient ML workflows within the Beam ecosystem.

### Background
Modern ML systems heavily rely on vector embeddings and feature management for efficient similarity search, recommendation systems, and ML model serving. While Apache Beam excels at data processing, it currently lacks native integration with Vector Databases and Feature Stores. This gap creates friction in ML workflows, requiring developers to build custom solutions or manage complex pipelines across multiple systems.

**How Apache Beam Works** (Quick Recap)
Apache Beam has two main parts when dealing with data:
1. **Sources** â€“ Read data from somewhere (Feast, Vertex AI, databases, etc.).
2. **Sinks** â€“ Write data to somewhere (databases, APIs, feature stores, etc.).
Right now, **Apache Beam can only read from Feast and Vertex AI Feature Store**, but we need a **sink** to **write data back**.

**What You Will Build**
ðŸ”§ **A new sink for Apache Beam that:** 
âœ… Takes processed data from Apache Beam. 
âœ… Writes this data back into **Feast** and **Vertex AI Feature Store**. 
âœ… Works efficiently (batching data instead of sending one by one).

## Implementation Approach

### Design Principles
- Create abstract interfaces for Vector DB operations
- Develop efficient batch processing mechanisms
- Implement robust error handling and retry strategies
- Ensure seamless integration with existing Apache Beam workflows

### Implementation Phases

Phase 1:
- Communicate with the mentor for additional info
- Complete the sink implementation of Vertex AI and Feast
- Test the code with existing code guidelines and implementation

Phase 2:
- Complete the sink and enrichment handler for Pinecone and Tecton
- Test the code for SageMaker integration

Phase 3:
- Document the changes
- If time is available, start working on Chroma integration

## Timeline and Commitments
I will dedicate 40-45 hours per week to the project:
- Weekdays: 6-7 hours per day
- Weekends: Additional hours for complex tasks
- Regular communication with mentors during their working hours

## Post-Project Sustainability
Commitments beyond the initial project:
- Expand support for additional vector databases
- Implement real-time feature update capabilities
- Create comprehensive example pipelines
- Foster community adoption and contributions
- Maintain ongoing documentation and support

## Expected Outcomes
