- **Tecton Integration Approach**: The Tecton connectors will build on their robust API, enabling both feature retrieval for model inference and feature ingestion from raw data. This complements existing analytics connectors (BigQuery, Snowflake) in the Beam ecosystem.

- **Feast & Vertex AI**: These implementations will complete the partially existing connectors, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions and adding missing sink functionality.

### **3. Performance Considerations**
Performance optimization will be a core focus, drawing on my experience benchmarking systems:

- **Batch Size Tuning**: Each connector will include configurable batch sizes optimized for throughput
- **Connection Pooling**: Implementations will use connection reuse to minimize overhead
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize Beam's parallelism capabilities for optimal distributed execution
- **Memory Management**: Carefully handle vector data to prevent out-of-memory scenarios with high-dimensional data
- **Benchmarking Framework**: Develop a consistent benchmarking approach to measure and improve performance
