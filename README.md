## **Project Details**  

### **Project Title**  
**Apache Beam I/O Connectors for Feature Stores and Vector Databases**  

### **Project Overview**  
This project aims to develop a suite of Apache Beam I/O connectors to integrate with various feature stores and vector databases, enhancing Apache Beam’s data processing capabilities. The implementation will include:  

1. **Feast Feature Store** – Sink Implementation  
2. **Vertex AI Feature Store** – Sink Implementation  
3. **Pinecone Vector Database** – Source & Sink Implementation  
4. **Tecton Feature Store** – Source & Sink Implementation  
5. **Amazon SageMaker** – Source & Sink Implementation  

### **Motivation**  
- Extend Apache Beam’s data integration capabilities.  
- Provide seamless connectivity for machine learning workflows.  
- Standardize I/O operations across different feature stores and vector databases.
