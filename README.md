# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

## ABSTRACT

The project aims to extend Apache Beam's ML capabilities by integrating Vector Databases and Feature Stores, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of high-dimensional vectors and ML features. This integration will bridge the gap between Beam's powerful data processing capabilities and modern ML infrastructure requirements, facilitating more efficient ML workflows within the Beam ecosystem.

## BACKGROUND

Modern ML systems heavily rely on vector embeddings and feature management for efficient similarity search, recommendation systems, and ML model serving. While Apache Beam excels at data processing, it currently lacks native integration with Vector Databases and Feature Stores. This gap creates friction in ML workflows, requiring developers to build custom solutions or manage complex pipelines across multiple systems.

The need for this integration is driven by:
- Growing adoption of vector-based similarity search in ML applications
- Increasing importance of feature management in ML pipelines
- Need for efficient handling of high-dimensional data at scale
- Demand for unified ML workflows within Beam

## PROJECT PROPOSAL

### OVERVIEW

This proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to integrate Vector Databases and Feature Stores with Apache Beam through two main components:

1. **Vector DB Integration**
   - Abstract interfaces for Vector DB operations
   - Implementation for popular Vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate)
   - Efficient batch processing and optimization
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Feature Store Integration**
   - Integration with Tecton and Feast
   - Support for batch and streaming features
   - Point-in-time correct feature retrieval
   - Feature versioning and lineage tracking

### TECHNICAL DESIGN

#### Core Architecture
```java
public interface VectorDatabaseIO<T> extends PTransform<PCollection<T>, PDone> {
    Write<T> write(VectorDBOptions options);
    Read<T> read(VectorDBQuery query);
    Delete delete(String[] ids);
}

public interface FeatureStoreIO<T> extends PTransform<PCollection<T>, PCollection<FeatureVector>> {
    FeatureRetrieval<T> getFeatures(FeatureView featureView);
    FeatureServing<T> serveFeatures(ServingConfig config);
}
```

#### Implementation Phases

1. **Week 1: Core Embedding Infrastructure**
   - Implement OpenAI embeddings PTransform
   - Add batch processing for efficient API usage
   - Implement caching mechanism
   - Add error handling and retry logic

2. **Weeks 2-4: Vector DB Integration**
   - Implement Pinecone and Weaviate connectors
   - Add batch processing capabilities
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add performance optimizations

3. **Weeks 5-8: Feature Store Integration**
   - Implement Feast and Tecton integration
   - Add feature versioning support
   - Implement point-in-time feature retrieval
   - Add monitoring and logging

4. **Weeks 9-12: Production Readiness**
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation
   - Community review

### TIMELINE AND COMMITMENTS

I will dedicate 30-35 hours per week to the project:
- Weekdays: 4-5 hours per day
- Weekends: Additional hours for complex tasks
- Regular communication with mentors during their working hours

### POST GSOC PLANS

I am committed to maintaining and expanding the project beyond GSoC:
- Adding support for additional Vector DBs and Feature Stores
- Implementing streaming support for real-time feature updates
- Creating comprehensive example pipelines
- Contributing to the broader Apache Beam ML ecosystem
- Maintaining documentation
- Supporting community adoption

### COMMUNICATION PLAN
- Primary communication via Slack and email
- Regular updates on dev mailing list
- Weekly sync-ups with mentors
- Active participation in community discussions
- Prompt response to code review feedback
