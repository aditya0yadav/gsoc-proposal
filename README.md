## BRIEF BIO

I am a Software Engineer at AcutusAI Private Insight Ltd with a strong background in Data Science and Mathematics. My experience includes both professional work and open source contributions, particularly to Apache projects. I have actively contributed to Apache Airflow with 10+ contributions and 5+ merged PRs, while also maintaining involvement in Apache ZooKeeper and Maven projects.

Through my professional work at AcutusAI, I've gained practical experience in implementing ML systems and distributed services. I've been instrumental in developing a synthetic data platform, QMAPI service using Generative AI, and a RAG-based chatbot system. Additionally, I've led the development of Opinomea, a survey panel serving 100k+ users.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

## ABSTRACT

The project aims to extend Apache Beam's ML capabilities by integrating Vector Databases and Feature Stores, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of high-dimensional vectors and ML features. This integration will bridge the gap between Beam's powerful data processing capabilities and modern ML infrastructure requirements, facilitating more efficient ML workflows within the Beam ecosystem.

## BACKGROUND

Modern ML systems heavily rely on vector embeddings and feature management for efficient similarity search, recommendation systems, and ML model serving. While Apache Beam excels at data processing, it currently lacks native integration with Vector Databases and Feature Stores. This gap creates friction in ML workflows, requiring developers to build custom solutions or manage complex pipelines across multiple systems.

The need for this integration is driven by several factors:
- Growing adoption of vector-based similarity search in ML applications
- Increasing importance of feature management in ML pipelines
- Need for efficient handling of high-dimensional data at scale
- Demand for unified ML workflows within Beam

## PROJECT PROPOSAL

### OVERVIEW

This proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to integrate Vector Databases and Feature Stores with Apache Beam through the following key components:

#### Core Components:

1. **Vector DB Integration**
   - Abstract interfaces for Vector DB operations
   - Implementation for popular Vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate)
   - Efficient batch processing and optimization
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Feature Store Integration**
   - Integration with Tecton and Feast
   - Support for batch and streaming features
   - Point-in-time correct feature retrieval
   - Feature versioning and lineage tracking

3. **Embedding Pipeline Components**
   - Integration with Hugging Face transformers
   - Batch processing optimizations
   - Caching mechanisms

#### Technologies

- Primary: Java, Python
- Frameworks: Apache Beam, Vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Feature Stores: Tecton, Feast
- ML Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers

### PLAN OF ACTION

#### Phase 1: ML Transform and Vector DB Integration (100 hours)

1. **OpenAI Embeddings Transform Integration (40h)**
   - Implement OpenAI embeddings PTransform
   - Add batch processing for efficient API usage
   - Implement caching mechanism for cost optimization
   - Add error handling and retry logic for API calls
   
   Example Implementation:
   ```python
   class OpenAIEmbeddingsTransform(PTransform):
       def __init__(self, api_key, model="text-embedding-ada-002", batch_size=100):
           self.api_key = api_key
           self.model = model
           self.batch_size = batch_size
   
       def expand(self, pcoll):
           return (pcoll 
                  | "Batch Elements" >> BatchElements(min_batch_size=10, 
                                                    max_batch_size=self.batch_size)
                  | "Generate Embeddings" >> ParDo(OpenAIEmbeddingDoFn(
                      self.api_key, self.model)))
   ```

2. **Pinecone Integration (30h)**
   - Implement basic CRUD operations
   - Add batch processing support
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Add type safety and validation

3. **Weaviate Integration (30h)**
   - Implement API connection
   - Add performance optimizations
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add batch insert capabilities

[Other phases remain similar but adjusted for timing]
